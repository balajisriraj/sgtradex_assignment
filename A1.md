This file contains optimized SQL queries for PostgreSQL(assumed since the db was not mentioned in the assignment provided) to analyze supply chain performance and business intelligence, as requested.

## SQL Analysis

### Supply Chain Performance

#### 1. Top 5 routes by total order value (2016-18)

This query identifies the top 5 shipping routes (defined by origin city to destination city) that generated the highest total order value between the years 2016 and 2018, inclusive. It sums the `Order Item Total` for each unique route.

```sql
-- Top 5 routes by total order value (2016-18)
SELECT
    s.Order_City AS origin_city,
    s.Customer_City AS destination_city,
    SUM(s.Order_Item_Total) AS total_order_value
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset s
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.Order_Date) BETWEEN 2016 AND 2018
GROUP BY
    s.Order_City,
    s.Customer_City
ORDER BY
    total_order_value DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### 2. Average shipping time difference (real vs scheduled) by shipping mode

This query calculates the average difference in days between the real shipping date (shipping_date_Date) and the scheduled shipping date (Days_for_shipping_real) for each Shipping_Mode. A positive difference indicates a delay, while a negative difference indicates earlier delivery.

```sql
-- Average shipping time difference (real vs scheduled) by shipping mode
SELECT
    Shipping_Mode,
    -- Calculate the average difference in days: (real shipping date - scheduled shipping date)
    -- We use EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...) / (60 * 60 * 24) to convert the difference in seconds to days
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (shipping_date_Date - Days_for_shipping_real)) / (60 * 60 * 24)) AS avg_shipping_time_difference_days
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
GROUP BY
    Shipping_Mode
ORDER BY
    avg_shipping_time_difference_days;
```

Note: The column Days_for_shipping_real is described as "Actual shipping days of the purchased product" in the data dictionary, implying it might be an integer representing days. However, given the nature of the request "real vs scheduled" and the other date columns, I'm interpreting Days_for_shipping_real as a date column for the purpose of calculating a time difference from shipping_date_Date. If Days_for_shipping_real is indeed an integer representing days, the calculation would need to be adjusted to AVG(shipping_date_Date - (Order_Date + INTERVAL '1 day' * Days_for_shipping_real)) or similar, assuming Order_Date is the base for scheduled days.
For this query, I'm assuming Days_for_shipping_real is a DATE or TIMESTAMP column representing the scheduled date, similar to shipping_date_Date as the real date.
Correction based on data dictionary: Days_for_shipping_real is "Actual shipping days of the purchased product" (integer) and Days_for_shipping_scheduled is "Scheduled days of the purchased product" (integer). Therefore, the actual difference in days should be calculated based on these integers.

---
Let me correct the SQL query for "Average shipping time difference (real vs scheduled) by shipping mode" to align with the data dictionary, where Days_for_shipping_real and Days_for_shipping_scheduled are integers representing days.

```sql
-- Average shipping time difference (real vs scheduled) by shipping mode (Corrected)
SELECT
    Shipping_Mode,
    -- Calculate the average difference in days: (Actual shipping days - Scheduled shipping days)
    AVG(Days_for_shipping_real - Days_for_shipping_scheduled) AS avg_shipping_time_difference_days
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
GROUP BY
    Shipping_Mode
ORDER BY
    avg_shipping_time_difference_days;
```

3. Products with late delivery risk and their profit impact
This query identifies products that have a Late_delivery_risk and calculates their total profit impact (sum of Order_Profit_Per_Order) from such instances.

```sql
-- Products with late delivery risk and their profit impact
SELECT
    Product_Name,
    SUM(Order_Profit_Per_Order) AS total_profit_impact
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
WHERE
    Late_delivery_risk = 'Yes' -- Assuming 'Yes' indicates late delivery risk
GROUP BY
    Product_Name
ORDER BY
    total_profit_impact DESC;
```
### Business Intelligence
1. Delivery status distribution by market region
This query shows the count of orders for each Delivery_Status within each Market region, providing insight into the performance of deliveries across different markets.
```sql
-- Delivery status distribution by market region
SELECT
    Market,
    Delivery_Status,
    COUNT(Order_Id) AS number_of_orders
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
GROUP BY
    Market,
    Delivery_Status
ORDER BY
    Market,
    number_of_orders DESC;
```

2. Seasonal patterns in order volumes by product category
This query analyzes seasonal patterns by counting the number of orders for each Product_Category per Order_Month and Order_Year. This helps in identifying peak seasons for different product categories.
```sql
-- Seasonal patterns in order volumes by product category
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Order_Date) AS Order_Year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Order_Date) AS Order_Month,
    Product_Category,
    COUNT(Order_Id) AS total_orders
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
GROUP BY
    Order_Year,
    Order_Month,
    Product_Category
ORDER BY
    Order_Year,
    Order_Month,
    total_orders DESC;
```

3. Customer segments with highest benefit per order
This query identifies customer segments based on Customer_Segment and calculates the average Order_Profit_Per_Order for each segment. This helps in understanding which customer segments are most profitable per order.

```sql
-- Customer segments with highest benefit per order
SELECT
    Customer_Segment,
    AVG(Order_Profit_Per_Order) AS average_profit_per_order
FROM
    DataCoSupplyChainDataset
GROUP BY
    Customer_Segment
ORDER BY
    average_profit_per_order DESC;
```
